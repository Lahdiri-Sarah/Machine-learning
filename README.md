 Image recognition and data classification

 This project leverages advanced techniques such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), neural networks, and Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) to perform handwritten digit recognition and extract information from documents like checks. It integrates preprocessing, scaling, classification, and result visualization into a fully automated and efficient workflow.
